      "message": "I know that this logic is equivalent with the old one, however this looks like a potential bug. Why can we start replicator only if we have local keystone enabled?\nI looked into the code and replication uses only one method from local keystone https://github.com/Juniper/contrail/blob/master/pkg/replication/client.go#L63 and this method is not specific to local keystone https://github.com/Juniper/contrail/blob/bb969af02762bf72608b77a70fbeb0f9571bc41f/pkg/keystone/api.go#L271\n\nMaybe we could fix it in this review?",

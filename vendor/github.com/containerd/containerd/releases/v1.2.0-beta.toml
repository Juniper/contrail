preface = """\
After two major releases of containerd, we have brought back the beta releases to
introduce a new runtime interface and new APIs. The 1.2 release will be fully
backwards compatible and has no API breakage. The API additions included in
this release are focused on making containerd more extensible and cover more
user cases.

### New V2 Runtime

A new v2 runtime has been added with a stable gRPC interface for managing
containers through external shims.

This allows runtime authors to easily integrate with containerd over a stable
API.

Various runtimes can be selected on a per container basis using the `WithRuntime` opt
or to test via ctr `ctr run --runtime io.containerd.runc.v1`.

[Documentation](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/runtime/v2/README.md)

### New Proxy Plugins

A new proxy plugin configuration has been added to allow external snapshotters
be connected to containerd using gRPC.

[Documentation](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/PLUGINS.md)

### Managed /opt directory

A new `Install` method on the containerd client allows users to publish host level
binaries using standard container build tooling and container distribution tooling
to download containerd related binaries on their systems.

This can be used for v2 runtime authors to get their runtime shims on an existing
containerd system. It can also be used to install `runc` and other related tools.

```bash
> ctr content fetch docker.io/crosbymichael/runc:latest
> ctr install docker.io/crosbymichael/runc:latest
```

[Documentation](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/docs/managed-opt.md)

### Garbage Collection

Add support for cleaning up leases and content ingests to garbage collections.

Add expiration label to clean up temporary resources.

### API Changes

Minor API additions

### Other Improvements

Improved multi-arch image support using more precise matching and ranking"""

Say I want it to download master like go get, but dep ensure or dep ensure --add github.com/docker/docker gave me v1.13.x which is useless. Have you encounter any problem like this?",

Latess docker releaser in Github repo were in 2017: https://github.com/moby/moby/tags?after\u003dv17.04.0-ce-rc1 so it picks one of them.\nSo we need to add constraint to get Docker from \"master\" branch.

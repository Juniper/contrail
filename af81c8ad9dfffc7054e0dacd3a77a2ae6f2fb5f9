      "message": "It was strange that when dep ensure was run, github.com/docker/docker was not downloaded as the latest version, instead, an old version that doesn\u0027t provide any function my code use was in vendor. Say I want it to download master like go get, but dep ensure or dep ensure --add github.com/docker/docker gave me v1.13.x which is useless. Have you encounter any problem like this?",

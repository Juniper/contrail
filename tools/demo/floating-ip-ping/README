To verify floating ip ping:

1. Create virtual machine
2. Open three terminals
3. Log them on the machine,
4. Create namespace (You can use example namespace: namespace.json),
5. Create project or use default-project or k8s-default,
6. Create Network IPAM with ipam_subnet_method: "user-defined-subnet",
7. Create Virtual Network with address_allocation_mode: "user-defined-subnet-only",
   network_ipam_refs set to previously created network ipam with added subnet in attr
   (see vn.yml),
8. Create Floating Ip Pool as a child of previously created Virtual Network with
   floating_ip_pool_subnets. You can check subnet uuid within Virtual Network,
9. Create two pods on different terminals to ensure normal ping between them is
   working,
10. Create clean Floating Ip as a child of Floating Ip Pool,
11. Check ip address allocated for Floating Ip. Try to ping it from any pod
    (it should fail),
12. Find Virtual Machine Interface connected with one of previously created pods,
13. Add Virtual Machine Interface Ref to Floating Ip,
14. Try to ping once again (now it should succed),
15. Enjoy your pinging!
